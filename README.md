### This is all codes for the back-end part of my Cool-Art social media, my own version of social media
<br> 

### You can: 
    * create your account 
    * showcase your artwork
    * edit your profile 
    * play a little games in it

### This is made using nodeJS, express, postgreSQL, and some other packages
<br>

## Here is the Live version 
 **[Cool-Art](https://cool-art-social-media.herokuapp.com)**.<br>
It is employed free heroku account, since it also offers free postgreSQL <br>
You might not be able to see anything except hello root, since it requires authorization with the database
